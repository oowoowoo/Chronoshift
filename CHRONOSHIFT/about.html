<h2>Our Purpose</h2>
<div class="purpose">

</div>

        <p>Chronoshift Expeditions’s purpose is clear: give people the gift of time travel. For hundreds of years it has been people’s dreams to go back in time, to experience life as it was. To see the world before humans were in existence is a privilege that not many will view. In the future, we hope to make our travel more accessible regardless of the heavy government regulations placed upon us.</p>

<h2>Our History</h2>
<div class="history">
<div class="map">

</div>

    <p>When our company had first begun, we were only a measly little hunting service. It was our founder, Steven Sanchez,
who had a passion for hunting and hoped to share the adrenaline he got with the rest of the world. After ten or so 
years, a new hire came around who was invested in science, Samantha Flores. She discovered a way to transport back,
albeit only beginning with ten seconds the first year. After vigorous study, successful travel was commenced and the
future of this company changed forever.</p>

<h2>Our Technology</h2>
<div class="tech">
<div class="code">
    <img src="img/code.jpg" alt="Woman with code projected onto face">
</div>

    <p>Our tech featured at Chronoshift Expeditions was brought upon us by many, many hours of study and testing. We can’t tell you exactly how we did it, (government laws and such) but the technology involves lots of atoms and brain power.</p>

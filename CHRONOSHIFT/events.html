<h2>New Expedition</h2>
<span class="author">Written by Samantha Flores</span>

<p>It’s a new year, which means it’s a new expedition! Coming to you live (not really) from Chronoshift Expeditions is a brand new journey for all of you die-hard prehistory fans. Upon many, many months of rigorous expedition and meticulous caution in order to keep the present unscathed, our team here has discovered a time period that is in fact safe for us to travel to, as well as hunt at.
    <br><br>
The ~Devonian~ Period!
    <br><br>
Featured in this brand new (again, not really!) era is aquatic life fit for fishing and a landscape that will keep you in awe for the rest of your life. In the next coming month, you will begin to see the addition of this period and its many animals to our options at checkout.
    <br><br>
Can’t wait to see you there!
<br><br>
P.S.!!!!
I’ve linked below some information on the Devonian period if any of you fish-lovers would be interested in planning ahead!</p>
